This is my AI-ML Technical training 3rd sem project 

Title-  Retail Store Cash vs Digital Payment Analysis
(Exploratory data analysis)

In this project I have build  pie-chart and trend plots explaining the modes of payments done in a giant grocery store.
#There are two way of payments that people do-
 1) By Cash        2) Digital payments

At first i have collected data of how many transactions are been done in which mode by people in the grocery store, Then i have sum up the total numbers of payments in both modes in time interval of a quarter of a year and made it my dataset for this project. 

after making the dataset i have started making Pie-chart and trend plots in vs-code.

first import pandas and matplotlib in python then import the dataset.

In pie-chart it shows the overall payment mode distribution from 2018 to 2025

in Trend plots it shows a graph between number of payments and time duration on trends of mode of payment between Cash and Digital payments.
